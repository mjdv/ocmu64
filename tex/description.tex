\begin{abstract}
  Given a bipartite graph $(A,B)$, the \emph{one-sided crossing minimization} (OCM) problem is to find an order of the
  vertices of $B$ that minimizes the number
  of edge crossings when drawn in the plane.

  We prove a number of novel reductions, and apply these in our solver OCMu64 that
  uses branch-and-bound on the order of the vertices of $B$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The 2024 edition of PACE, an annual optimization challenge, considers the
\emph{one-sided crossing minimization} problem, defined as follows.
Given is a bipartite graph $(A, B)$ that is drawn in the plane at points
$(0, i)$ and $(1,j)$ for components $A$ and $B$ respectively. The order of $A$
is fixed, and the goal is the find an order of $B$ that minimizes the number of
crossings when edges are drawn as straight lines.

We introduce some new reductions and overview our algorithm. Proofs are brief or
omitted due to lack of space.

\section{Definitions}
Since the order of $A$ is fixed, we set $A=\{0, \dots, [A]\}$ (where $[n]=\{0,\dots,n-1\}$) and draw the
vertices in this order.
Let $u, v\in B$ be two vertices in $B$. Then $N(u),N(v)\subseteq A$ are their sets of
neighbours.
We write $c(u,v)=\sum_{a\in N(u)}\sum_{b\in N(v)} [a>b]$ for the number of crossings between edges from $u$ and $v$
when $u$ is drawn before $v$. For $X,Y\subseteq B$ we set
$c(X,Y) = \sum_{x\in X}\sum_{y\in Y} c(x,y)$ for the cost of ordering all
vertices of $X$ before all vertices of $Y$.
More generally, $c(X,Y,Z) = c(X, Y) + c(X, Z) + c(Y, Z)$.
We also consider the \emph{reduced cost} $r(X,Y) = c(X, Y) - c(Y, X)$, which is
negative when $X$ is better \emph{before} $Y$ and positive when $X$ is better \emph{after} $Y$.

We write $u\b v$ when $u$ must come before $v$ in all minimal solutions and
$u\be v$ when there exist minimal solutions where $u$ comes before $v$, and we
call such $(u,v)$ \emph{dominating pairs}.
We write $u\g v$ when there is a minimal solution where $u$ and $v$ are
consecutive, in that order.

The following result is well known.

% TODO: Citation
\begin{observation}\label{lem:weak}
  When all neighbours of $u$ come before all neighbours of $v$, then $u$ goes
  before $v$. I.e., when $\max N(u) \leq \min N(v)$, then $u\be v$.
  When additionally ${\min N(u) < \max N(v)}$, then $u\b v$.
\end{observation}

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Reductions}
\subparagraph{Dominating pairs}
We give a much stronger version of \cref{lem:weak}. In fact, this
lemma is as strong as can be when only considering $N(u)$ and $N(v)$.

\begin{lemma}[Strong dominating pair]\label{lem:sdp}
  Write $n:= |N(u)|$, $m:=|N(v)|$, and consider both sets as sorted lists.
  When for all $i\in [n]$ we have
  $ N(u)_i \leq N(v)_{\lfloor i\cdot m/n \rfloor} $,
  then $u\be v$.
  When there is an $i$ such that the inequality is strict, then $u\b v$.
\end{lemma}

%Note that the condition is equivalent to the symmetric version: for all $j\in [m]$:
%$ U_{\lceil j\cdot n/m \rceil} \leq V_j $.

\begin{proof}
  Consider for each $u\in B$ the function $w_u: A\to \R_{\geq 0}$ that
  assigns \emph{weight} $1$ to neighbours of $u$ and weight $0$ otherwise.
  Let $W_u = \sum_{a\in A} w_u(A)$ be the total weight (degree) of $u$.
  Then for any $u$ and $v$, $c(u,v) = \sum_{a,b\in A, a>b} w_u(a) \cdot w_v(b)$.
  We can `shift' some weight $\delta$ of $w_u$ to the right from $a_1$ to $a_2>a_1$ by
  decreasing $w_u(a_1)\geq \delta$ by $\delta$ and increasing $w_u(a_2)$ by
  $\delta$.
  This increases the value of
  $c(u,v)$ by $\delta \cdot \sum_{a_1 < b \leq a_2} w_b(v)\geq 0$.

  Consider \emph{scaled} functions $\w_u = w_u / W_u$ and $\w_v = w_v / W_v$.
  We have $c(u,v) = W_u\cdot W_v\cdot c(\u, \v)$ and $c(v,u) = W_u\cdot
  W_v\cdot c(\v, \u)$, so that the sign of $r(u,v) = W_u\cdot W_v\cdot
  r(\w_u, \w_v)$ is independent of scaling.
  The condition in the lemma holds if and only if $\w_u$ can be transformed into
  $\w_v$ by shifting weight to the right.

  Now suppose there is an optimal solution where $v$ occurs before $x$:
  $(\dots, v, x_1, \dots, x_k, u, \dots)$.
  We set $X=(x_1,\dots, x_k)$ and write $w_X=\sum_{i=1}^k w_i$ for the combined weight of the
  neighbours of the $x_i$.
  Since the solution is optimal, we have $r(v,X) \leq 0$ and $r(X, u) \leq 0$,
  and hence $r(\v, X)\leq 0$ and $r(X, \u) \leq 0$.
  Since we can go from $\w_u$ to $\w_v$ by shifting weight to the right, we have
  $r(\u, X) \leq r(\v, X)$. We get $0 \leq -r(X, \u) = r(\u, X) \leq r(\v, X)
  \leq 0$. Thus, all must equal $0$, and $(v, X, u)$ is as good as $(v, u, X)$. By a
  similar argument we can swap $u$ and $v$ to obtain $(u, v, X)$. We conclude
  $u\be v$.
  When one of the inequalities in the condition is strict that implies $c(u,v) <
  c(v,u)$ and we have $u\b v$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  When the condition in \cref{lem:sdp} does not hold, there exists a multiset
  $\mathcal X\subseteq A$ such that $v, \mathcal X, u$ is the optimal order.
\end{remark}

Although such a set $\mathcal X$ may exist in theory, it does not have to exist in
practice, motivating the following definition.

\begin{lemma}[Practical dominating pair]\label{pdp}
  Suppose $r(u,v)\leq 0$.
  A \emph{blocking} set $X\subseteq B-\{u,v\}$ is a set such that $c(v,X,u)$ is
  stricly better than both $c(u,v,X)$ and $c(X,u,v)$.
  If there is no blocking set, then $u\be v$.
\end{lemma}

In practice, such a set $X$ can be found, if one exists, using knapsack: for
each $x\in B-\{u,v\}$, add a point $P_x = (r(v, x), r(x, u))$, and search for a
subset summing to ${\leq{}(r(u, v), r(u, v))}$.

Note that we do not require $(v, X, u)$ to be a true local minimum, since we do
not consider interactions between vertices in $X$, as that would make finding
such sets much harder.

\subparagraph{Gluing}
We now turn our attention to \emph{gluing}, i.e., proving that two vertices $u$
and $v$ always go right next to each other. We start with a simple case of
\emph{gluing to the front}.

\begin{lemma}[Greedy]\label{greedy}
  When $r(u, x)\leq 0$ for all $x\in B$, there is a solution that
  starts with $u$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{remark}
  Let $u$ and $v$ satisfy $r(u,v) \leq 0$.
  When $N(u)=N(v)$ or more generally $\w_u=\w_v$, we can glue $u$ and $v$: $u\g v$.
  Otherwise, there is a multiset $\mathcal X\subseteq A$ such that $(u, X, v)$ is
  better than $(u,v,X)$ and $(X,u,v)$.
\end{remark}
This means that there is no `strong gluing'.
\begin{lemma}[Practical gluing]\label{pg}
  Let $u$ and $v$ satisfy $r(u,v)\leq 0$ and $u\be v$.
  A subset $X\subseteq B-\{u,v\}$ is \emph{blocking} when $c(u, X, v)$ is strictly
  better than $c(u,v,X)$ and $c(X,u,v)$.
  If there is no blocking set, then $u \g v$.
\end{lemma}
Again such sets $X$ can be found or proven to not exist using a knapsack
algorithm: add points $P_x = (r(u, x), r(x, v))$ and search for a non-empty
set summing to $\leq{}(0,0)$.

\begin{remark}[Tail variants]
  Our branch-and-bound method fixes vertices of the
solution from left to right. That means that at each step \cref{pg,pdp} can be applied to
just the \emph{tail}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Branch-and-bound}
Our solver \texttt{OCMu64} is based on a standard branch-and-bound on the order the solution.
We start with fixed prefix $P=()$ and tail $T=B$, and in each step we try (a
subset of) all vertices in $T$ as the next vertex appended to $P$.
In a preprocessing step we compute the trivial lower bound $S_0 =
\sum_{u,v}\min(c(u,v),c(v,u))$ on the score.
We keep track of the score $S_P$ of the prefix and $S_{PT}=c(P, T)$ of
prefix-tail intersections, and abort when this score goes above the best
solution found so far. The \emph{excess} of a tail is its optimal score above
the trivial lower bound. We do a number of optimizations.

\begin{description}
  \item[Graph simplification] We drop degree-$0$ vertices, merge identical
    vertices, and split the graph into \emph{independent} components when
    possible. We find an initial solution using local search that tries to move
    slices and optimally insert them, and re-label all nodes accordingly to make
    memory accesses more efficient.
  \item[Dominating pairs] We find all dominating pairs and store them. For the
    exact track we also find practical dominating pairs. Instances for the parameterized
    track are simple enough that the overhead was not worth it. Also for each
    tail we search for new `tail-local' practical dominating pairs. In each state, we only
    try vertices $u\in T$ not dominated by another $v\in T$.
  \item[Gluing] We use the greedy strategy \cref{greedy}. Our implementation
    of \cref{pg} contained a bug, so we did not use this. (Also benefits
    seemed limited.)
  \item[Tail cache] In each step, we search for the longest suffix of $T$ that
    has been seen before, and reuse (the lower bound on) its excess. We also
    cache the tail-local practical dominating pairs.
  \item[Optimal insert] Instead of simply appending $u$ to the end of $P$, we
    insert it in the optimal position.\footnote{The idea is simple, but the
    implementation is tricky because it interacts in complicated ways with
    the caching of results for each tail.}
\end{description}

\section{Discussion}
\texttt{OCMu64} is a simple branch-and-bound method for solving one-sided
crossing minimization that does not depend on advanced ILP or SAT solvers.

This also seems to be its biggest limitation: while LP methods can use
the dual-space, \texttt{OCMu64} only considers the primal space to find lower
bounds on subproblems.
